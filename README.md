# Day 83 Task | Cohort 2.0

This repository contains the work completed as part of **Day 77** in **Sheryians Coding School – Cohort 2.0**.  
The focus of this task was to build a **Pokédex-style application using React**, with emphasis on API integration, asynchronous data fetching, component-based architecture, and a clean card-based UI using Tailwind CSS.

## 🖼️ Project Overview

The application provides an interactive **Pokédex interface** where users can:

- Fetch Pokémon data from a public API
- View Pokémon details in card format
- Display Pokémon images, types, abilities, and stats
- Render multiple Pokémon in a responsive grid layout


### 🎬 Project Preview

Each Pokémon is rendered using a **reusable Card component**, ensuring clean structure and scalability.

## 🧩 Features Implemented

| Feature | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔗 API Integration | Fetches Pokémon data from PokéAPI |
| ⚡ Async Data Fetching | Uses `axios` with `async/await` |
| 🃏 Pokémon Cards | Displays Pokémon in clean card layout |
| 🖼️ Images | Shows official Pokémon artwork |
| 🧬 Types | Displays Pokémon types using badges |
| ✨ Abilities | Lists abilities for each Pokémon |
| 📊 Stats | Displays base stats with progress bars |
| 🔄 State Management | React `useState` hook |
| 🧩 Component-Based | Separate `Card.jsx` component |
| 📐 Responsive Grid | 4 cards per row on large screens |
| 🎨 Tailwind CSS | Clean and modern styling |

## ✨ Key Learning Highlights

Through this task, I learned to:

- Work with third-party APIs in React
- Handle multiple API calls using `Promise.all`
- Manage asynchronous operations cleanly
- Build reusable and scalable components
- Render dynamic data using `.map()`
- Design responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React.js
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS
- HTML5
- PokéAPI

## 📖 Learning Outcome

By completing Day 77, I strengthened my understanding of:

- API-driven React applications
- State management using hooks
- Component reusability
- Clean UI design with Tailwind CSS
- Structuring scalable frontend projects
