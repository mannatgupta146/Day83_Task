# Day 83 Task | Cohort 2.0

This repository contains the work completed as part of **Day 83** in **Sheryians Coding School – Cohort 2.0**.  
The focus of this task was to build a **modern e-commerce style product application using React**, with emphasis on **routing, context-based state management, API integration**, and a **clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS**.


## 🖼️ Project Overview

The application provides a **basic e-commerce flow** where users can:

- Browse products fetched from a public API
- View products in a clean card-based layout
- Navigate between pages using React Router
- Open individual product detail pages
- View detailed information such as price, category, rating, and description

The project follows a **component-based architecture** and uses **Context API** for global state management.


## 🧩 Features Implemented

| Feature | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔗 API Integration | Fetches product data from FakeStore API |
| ⚡ Async Data Fetching | Uses `axios` with `async/await` |
| 🛍️ Product Listing | Displays products in responsive card layout |
| 🔍 Product Details | Individual product page using dynamic routes |
| 🧭 Routing | Implemented using React Router |
| 🧠 Context API | Centralized product data management |
| 📐 Responsive Design | Works across different screen sizes |
| 🎨 Tailwind CSS | Clean, modern, and reusable UI styles |
| 📌 Fixed Navbar | Sticky navigation with active link styling |
